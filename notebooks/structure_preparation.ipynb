The [generate_apo_kinases.py](https://github.com/openkinome/kinase-conformational-modeling/tree/main/scripts/generate_apo_kinases.py) script uses functionalities from the [KinoML framework](https://github.com/openkinome/kinoml/) to automatically prepare protein kinases found in KLIFS for a given KLIFS kinase ID (human ABL1 - 392, human EGFR - 406) including different chains and alternate locations. This resulted in the preparation of 84 structures for human ABL1 and 400 structures for human EGFR."
